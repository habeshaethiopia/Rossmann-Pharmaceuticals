# **Rossmann Store Sales Forecasting**

This project focuses on building a machine learning model to forecast sales for Rossmann stores six weeks ahead.

## **Data**

* Source: Rossmann Store Sales | Kaggle
* Features:
    * `Store`: Unique identifier for each store.
    * `Sales`: Daily turnover (target variable).
    * `Customers`: Number of customers on a given day.
    * `Open`: Indicates if the store was open (0: closed, 1: open).
    * `StateHoliday`: Indicates state holidays (a: public, b: Easter, c: Christmas, 0: None).
    * `SchoolHoliday`: Indicates if the (Store, Date) was affected by school closures.
    * `StoreType`: Differentiates between 4 store models (a, b, c, d).
    * `Assortment`: Assortment level (a: basic, b: extra, c: extended).
    * `CompetitionDistance`: Distance to the nearest competitor store.
    * `CompetitionOpenSince[Month/Year]`: Approximate opening date of the nearest competitor.
    * `Promo`: Indicates if a store is running a promo on that day.
    * `Promo2`: Indicates participation in a continuous and consecutive promotion.
    * `Promo2Since[Year/Week]`: Start year and week of Promo2 participation.
    * `PromoInterval`: Describes the consecutive intervals Promo2 is started.

## **Objectives**

1. **Exploration of Customer Purchasing Behavior:**
    * Analyze customer behavior patterns.
    * Investigate the impact of promotions, holidays, and competition on sales.
    * Identify potential areas for improvement in store operations and marketing strategies.

2. **Prediction of Store Sales:**
    * Develop and evaluate machine learning models to forecast sales six weeks in advance.
    * Consider various model architectures (e.g., linear regression, time series models, tree-based models).

3. **Machine Learning Approach:**
    * Implement a robust machine learning pipeline, including data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation.
    * Tune hyperparameters to optimize model performance.

4. **Deep Learning Approach:**
    * Explore deep learning models (e.g., recurrent neural networks, convolutional neural networks) for potential performance gains.

5. **Serving Predictions on a Web Interface:**
    * Develop a user-friendly web interface to deliver sales forecasts to analysts in the finance team.

## **Project Structure**

* `src/`: Contains Python source code for data loading, preprocessing, modeling, and visualization.
* `notebooks/`: Jupyter Notebooks for exploratory data analysis and model development.
* `data/`: Stores raw and processed data.
* `models/`: Stores trained model files.
* `web_app/`: Contains files for the web application (if applicable).
* `docs/`: Contains documentation, including this README file.

**Logging**

* Utilizes the `logging` library for logging events during the project.
* Logs are stored in `rossmann_sales_exploration.log`.

**Further Steps**

* Conduct more in-depth feature engineering (e.g., time-based features, lag features).
* Explore ensemble methods and stacking techniques to improve model performance.
* Deploy the model to a production environment for real-time predictions.
* Monitor model performance and retrain periodically to adapt to changing market conditions.
